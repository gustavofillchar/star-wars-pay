This project was developed to showcase frontend development skills. It utilizes the public Star Wars API [`swapi.dev`](https://swapi.dev/) to retrieve data on planets and characters.

Built with React (Next.js) and styled using Tailwind CSS, the project employs unit testing with Jest and Testing Library to validate core component functionality and features.
