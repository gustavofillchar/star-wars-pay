This project was developed to showcase frontend development skills. It utilizes a public Star Wars API [`(swapi.dev)`](https://swapi.dev/) that returns planets and characters. 

This project was developed using React (Next.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS. I employed a unit testing approach with Jest and Testing Library to validate the functionality of the app's core components and features.
